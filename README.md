[What should I do next?](https://drarnakarick.github.io/decision-maker/)

A website that makes decisions so I don't have to.

For when I'm feeling overwhelmed by my to read/create/learn list and I don't want to have to make a decision, or for when I need a break and want to avoid wasting precious time interwebbing.
